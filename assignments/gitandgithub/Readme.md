<!-- Git and GitHub

git is not github it is a version control system.

Save your code often, every major change, commit.


pwd - present working directory -

**ls is going to list everything thats in the folder that your in

**ls -a shows everything even hidden files

cd - changes directory

.. - goes up a folder

../.. - goes up two folders **you can hit the tab key to fill in that folder name if you want to go a specific folder

touch - creates a file (touch.testing.html) will create a testing file.

**macs don't like the word code but they do like the word open

mkdir (name)- (no spaces if its a space it'll assume its something new) make directory we are now making a new folder

Github

Two ways to create a repository.

First way is to do on on github

Terminal way:

mkdir testRepo
cd tesRepo
git init

>ls - a you will see a ./../.git/ folder (this is how you can tell you're in a git repository)
(to remove): rm -r testRepo
**Melissa recommends to start every project on git first.

Still have to create the repository on Github

(problem:: create repository on github but I've already locally - do not do gitignore readme or license it will create a merge conflict)

.gitignore - there are things that you do not want to go to github and .gitignore is a place where you can add to never go to github.
