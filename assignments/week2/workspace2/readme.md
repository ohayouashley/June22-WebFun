NOTES WEEK 2

CSS

**Learn how to use display: flex; and how it's applied to parent element to style its children
**Learn how display:flex; ignores whitespace in HTML when positioning elements

-Use display:flex on the parent "container" div and then we can write our HTML
with our usual indentation and we can avoid having the new line and tabs between divs take up space.


::NOTE::

The align-items: center; will prevent the columns from stretching (inheriting the height of the parent container div). 

Try values flex-start and flex-end.
